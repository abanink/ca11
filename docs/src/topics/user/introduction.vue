    <h2>Requirements</h2>

    <h3>Headset</h3>
    <p>
        In order to get a good calling experience, it is important to use a decent headset
        with the right ergonomics and sound quality. Also you should verify that the correct
        audio device is being used by {{app.name}}.

    <h4>Bluetooth</h4>
    <p>
        Bluetooth headsets should work just fine, but there are more potential
        problems with it. We have tested succesfully with some Plantronics headsets,
        but other headsets should work fine as well.
    </p>

    <h4>USB</h4>
    <p>
        While there is not a list of supported headsets, it is generally save to
        say that any USB headset should work.
    </p>

    <h4>Jack</h4>
    <p>
        Headsets with a jack should be fine, but they don't show up as a
        separate device in the Devices list.
