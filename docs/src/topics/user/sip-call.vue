            {{app.name}} supports calls from and to legacy Telecom networks using the
            SIP protocol, but the {{vendor.name}} company is not a Telecom provider.
            In no event will {{vendor.name}} be liable for any loss, damage or fraud
            that might result from using {{app.name}} with a third-party SIP service.

        Enabling {{app.name}}'s SIP feature enhances your call reach to traditional
        telephony networks. You can basically call and be called  by anything from
        a landline, to a mobile, a service number or any device that communicates
        using the SIP protocol. Please note that, in comparison to SIG11 calls,
        SIP calls are only encrypted between you and your SIP service provider.
        SIG11 calls are end-to-end encrypted between you and your callee/caller.
