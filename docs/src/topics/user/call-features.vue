    <h1>Call Features</h1>

    <p>
        During a call, there are several softphone features you can use. Please
        note that these features are derived from the SIP softphone. Most of
        them currently don't work with SIG11 calling.

        Transfer is currently a SIP-only feature. Both attended and
        blind transfers are supported. Press the <em>Transfer</em> button
        during a call.
