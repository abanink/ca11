    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>
        CA11 is a decentralized internet telephony platform for secure free calling, conferencing and collaboration.<img class="illustration right" src="/img/illustration-1.jpg"/>
        Calls are protected with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5764">standards-based</a>
        encryption and use high quality
        <a href="https://www.webmproject.org/vp9/">video</a> and
        <a href="http://opus-codec.org/">audio</a>.<br/><br/>

        CA11 can also be used to receive and make SIP calls,
        but this requires an account from a compatible VoIP provider.
        Calls on a VoIP network have less privacy protection, but have
        the benefit of making you reachable on a broader range of
        phone networks. Checkout the <router-link to="/users/requirements">requirements</router-link>
