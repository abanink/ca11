    <h1>Welcome to CA11</h1>
    <p>

        CA11 is a free WebRTC softphone and decentralized phone network that
        enables people to receive and make peer-to-peer calls, video calls and
        screen sharing sessions. <img class="illustration right" src="/img/illustration-1.jpg"/>
        Call privacy is protected with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5764">standards-based</a>
        encryption technology and offers high quality
        <a href="https://www.webmproject.org/vp9/">video</a> and
        <a href="http://opus-codec.org/">audio</a>.<br/><br/>

        CA11 can also be used to receive and make SIP calls,
        but this requires an account from a compatible VoIP provider.
        Calls on a VoIP network have less privacy protection, but have
        the benefit of making you reachable on a broader range of
        phone networks. Checkout the <router-link to="/users/requirements">requirements</router-link>
