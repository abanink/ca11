# Contributing
Nice to see you're interested in contributing! You're encouraged to
contribute to CA11. The CA11 community is a friendly place where
respect in all communication is expected; so please be aware and
follow the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). The guidelines
below are here to make your contribution effective:


## Issues
* Please don't use Github issues for support questions
* Be elaborate when filling out an issue and use the issue template
* Create a pull request with a proposed fix if you can


## Pull requests
* All CI tests must pass
* Use the included linters as styleguide
* Use conventional-commit messages (CI-enforced)
* Use a clear description of the purpose of your code
* The purpose must be generic enough to be integrated; this is open for discussion
* A pull-request may get rejected by a core contributor
