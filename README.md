# Mission
CA11's mission is to open up the Telecom industry by introducing free, open and
privacy-friendly Web Telephony. CA11 is backwards compatible with SIP networks,
and comes with its own free decentralized signalling network for P2P telephony:
SIG11. P2P telephony with WebRTC and SIG11 has some major advantages over
centralized telephony:

* Privacy: all WebRTC calls are P2P and securely encrypted (DTLS-SRTP)
* Trust: Public key crypto verifies caller & callee identity
* Quality: High quality audio(OPUS) and video(VP9)
* Costs: Free for users, low costs for SIG11 network operators
* Scalability: Low-cost simple relay signalling services instead of large media pipes
* Customizable: Plugin-based, themable phone
* Integrations: Combines perfectly with other communication software, like web-based CRM software
* Freedom: Open network, no accounts, select your own number on the fly
* Features: Everything a regular phone does + Web + WebRTC Audio/Video/Data
* Ubiquitous: Runs on web; PWA experience everywhere Chrom(ium/e) runs
