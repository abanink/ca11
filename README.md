# Purpose
CA11's purpose is to open up Telecom by introducing open, free and secure
Web Telephony. CA11 is backwards compatible with SIP networks, and comes with its
own free decentralized signalling network for P2P telephony; SIG11. P2P telephony
with WebRTC and SIG11 has major advantages over centralized telephony:

* Privacy: all WebRTC calls are P2P and securely encrypted (DTLS-SRTP)
* Trust: Not a phonenumber, but public keys verify caller/callee identity
* Quality: High quality audio(OPUS) and video(VP9)
* Costs: Free for users, low costs for SIG11 network operators
* Scalable: Simple signalling relay services instead of large media pipes
* Customizable: Plugin-based, themable phone
* Freedom: Open network, no accounts, select your own number on the fly
* Features: Everything a regular phone does + Web + WebRTC Audio/Video/Data
* Ubiquitous: Runs on web; PWA experience everywhere Chrom(ium/e) runs
